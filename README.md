##Summary

This is a learning project for Rails 3.1, CoffeeScript, Jasmine and some
HTML5/Canvas.

The application is a simple game. Players take it in turns to insert a
coloured counter into a 7x7 grid. The object of the game is to get four
counters in a line, vertically, horizontally or diagonally. The game
ends when a player achieves this and that player is deemed the winner. If
neither player gets four in a line by the time the grid gets filled up
then the game is deemed to end in a draw.

For now its a single player game in which the user takes on the
machine. It could be adapted for two-player gaming over the net.

##TODO List

* Implement the game rules - end of game and results.
* Implement a moderately 'intelligent' player to take on the user.
* User registration - so that you can view your previous games and
  relive past victories.
